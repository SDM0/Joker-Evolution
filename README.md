# Joker Evolution
A Balatro mod made by **SDM_0** which gives an evolution to a few jokers.

Contains an API as well as an example Joker to create your own evolutions.

Inspired of [Fusion Jokers](https://github.com/itayfeder/Fusion-Jokers) by [itayfeder](https://github.com/itayfeder).<br>
Thanks to [MathIsFun](https://github.com/MathIsFun0) for the help and RattlingSnow353 for the sprite!

## Installation
- Requires [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded/) v1.0.0 or higher (An installation guide is available there)
- Download `Joker_Evolution.zip` in "Releases"
- Unzip it into `AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods` (Create the "Mods" folder if it doens't exist)

## Evolutions
- A Joker can evolve if it has an evolution, is present along your other Jokers and its requirement has been met.
- A requirement is a goal that needs to be reached, it is initiated when the Joker is added and increased when a condition is met.
- A condition increases by 1 by default, when the amount of condition is met, the Joker will shake and a button "Evolve" will
show when clicking on it, allowing it to evolve.
- A Joker slot isn't required when evolving a Joker.
- When a Joker evolves, its pre-evolution will not be available (configurable)
- Editions and badges (eternal/perish/rental/pinned) are kept when evolving.
- Debuffed Jokers cannot evolve.
